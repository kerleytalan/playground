# playground
This is a playground where I store learning projects that aren't worth a full repository as well as tracking learning progress.
# Active recall
This was my first project after leaving CS50. It's relatively simple but taught me a fair bit. It simply parses CSV files and reads them when prompted in a QA format. It's extremely buggy, memory inefficient and poorly designed.
