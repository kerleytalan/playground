This is a playground where I store learning projects that aren't worth a full repository as well as tracking learning progress.

This was my first project after leaving CS50. It's relatively simple but taught me a fair bit. It simply parses CSV files and reads them when prompted in a QA format. It's extremely buggy, memory inefficient, poorly designed and insecure.. Specifically, I learn why scanf is a horrible function. How to use strtok. How to parse CSV files and how to work with file manipulation in general. I'm not too proud of it but it's a decent project to break the ice, I think. Not the best start.
